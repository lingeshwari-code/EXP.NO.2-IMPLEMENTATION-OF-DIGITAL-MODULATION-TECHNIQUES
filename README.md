2.Implementation of Digital Modulation Techniques
    i) Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)
    ii) Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)
    iii) Phase Shift Keying (PSK)
## AIM    
 To Study and Realize ASK,FSK and PSK Modulation and Demodulation using the Digital Modulation Trainer Kit. 
## APPARATUS REQUIRED
Trainer Kit, DSO(10MHz) , Patch Cords and Power Supply (0-30V) 
## PROCEDURE
For ASK: 
1. Refer to the Fig. 1.1 and carry out the following connections and switch settings. 
2. Connect power supply in proper polarity to the kit DCL-06 and switch it on.
3. Connect SERIAL DATA generated on board to CONTROL IN of CARRIER MODULATOR. 
4. Select ASK modulation using switch S1, the ASK LED will glow. 
5. Observe the waveforms at SINE1, SINE2 and MOD OUT. 
6. Connect ASK modulated signal MOD oUT to the ASK IN of the ASK DEMODULATOR.
7. Observe various waveforms as mentioned below. 
For FSK: 
1. Refer to the Fig. 2.1 and carry out the following connections and switch settings. 
2. Connect power supply in proper polarity to the kit DCL-06 and switch it on. 
3. Connect SERIAL DATA generated on board to CONTROL INPUT of CARRIER MODULATOR. 
4. Select FSK modulation using switch S1, the FSK LED will glow. 
5. Observe the waveforms at SINE 1,SINE 2 and MOD OUT. 
6. Connect FSK modulated signal MOD OUT to the FSK IN of the FSK DEMODULATOR.
7. Observe various waveforms as rmentioned below. 
For PSK: 
1. Refer to the Fig. 3.1 and carry out the following connections and switch settings. 
2. Connect power supply in proper polarity to the kit DCL-06 and switch it on. 
3. Connect SERIAL DATA generated on board to CONTROL INPUT of CARRIER MODULATOR. 
3. Select PSK modulation using switch S1, the PSK LED will glow.
4. Observe the waveforms at SINE 1, SINE 2 and MOD OUT.
5. Connect PSK modulated signal MOD OUT to the PSK IN of the PSK DEMODULATOR.
6. Observe various waveforms as mentioned below.
